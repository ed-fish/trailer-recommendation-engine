Basic trailer recommendation engine using an audio-visual video transformer network and ANNOY

Generates approximate nearest neighbours of embedding vectors retrieved from a model trained only on audio-visual features (no meta data!) 

Currently only features 580 trailers taken randomly from the validation set of MMX-20 Trailer Dataset.
